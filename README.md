## Statement of Purpose
This repository documents the work of the contributors on the MaCSS Advanced Computing final project. Our study investigates American in-group and out-group sentiment and identity through analyzing U.S. presidential transcripts through the nation’s history. We accomplished this through three main methods: grading the sentiment associated with different in and out groups, identifying which groups and traits are considered more or less “American,” and tracking trends in in-group versus out-group language in identifying “Americans” over time.

Our methods and code can be found within the notebooks folder, and our data within the data folder. All LLM use is documented and examined within the notebooks.

# How to Use
You can download this repository and run the code to reproduce our results. Different methods of analysis are located in different notebooks of analysis. The code may produce additional dataframes not in the repository when run in order to save results.
